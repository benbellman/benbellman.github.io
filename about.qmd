I'm a data scientist and writer, and I currently work as a Senior Data Analyst in the Boulder County justice system. I have experience as a consultant for Ivy League researchers and in professional soccer. Outside of data, I love poetry, music, maps, games, and laughing.

This blog is a space to hack code, share ideas, and have fun. Maybe a poem or two will appear! I've found so many useful things on blogs just like this, so I hope you find something useful here.

Data for good, never evil!
