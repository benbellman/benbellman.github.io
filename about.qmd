I'm a data scientist and writer that wants to make life better for both people and the planet. I like soccer, trivia, poetry, music, maps, and a bunch of other random stuff.

This blog is a space to hack code, share ideas, and have fun. I've found so many useful things on blogs just like this, so I hope you find something useful here.

Data for good, never evil!
