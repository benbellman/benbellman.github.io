I'm a data scientist and writer, and I currently work as a Senior Data Analyst in the Boulder County justice system. I have consulted with an MLS club and a legendary MLS player, among others in soccer and science. Through my justice work, I've developed a knack for helping inexperienced data customers get the insights they need. Please [contact me](mailto:bhbellman@yahoo.com) if you'd like to discuss your soccer, social, or spatial data problems.

Beyond my professional passions, I love food, poetry, music, maps, games, laughing, and learning about the world.This blog is a space to hack code, share ideas, and have fun. I've found so many useful things on blogs just like this, so I hope you find something useful here.

Data for good, never evil.
