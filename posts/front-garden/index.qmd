a stillness encased\
by leaves and bark

shading the battalion\
columns marching up

towering cinderblock cliffs\
reinforced battlements

overlook warring forests\
of dill and mint and chives

thick with buzzing fragrance\
an idyll unsheared unmoored   
   
picketed by peeling paint\
asphalt rubber plastic rust

ours and now ownerless again
