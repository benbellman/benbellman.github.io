(2023) \"From Side Street to Ghetto: Understanding the Rising Levels and Changing Spatial Pattern of Segregation, 1900‚Äì1940.\" City & CommunityAbstractA standard interpretation of the intensification of segregation in the early twentieth century is that residents of Northern cities reacted against a growing African American presence, using segregation as a tool of social control that was less needed in the South. Evidence from newly available data for 134 cities in 1900‚Äì1940 puts this interpretation in question in several ways. We find that segregation was already high in 1900 at the neighborhood scale. Not only was it rising, but it was changing its spatial scale as clusters of Black settlement in side streets and alleys disappeared from White districts while expanding into large Black zones. Finally, multivariate analyses show that trends were similar in the North and South, and in neither region was Black population size (i.e., ‚ÄúBlack threat‚Äù) a significant predictor of increasing segregation. The general trends of rising segregation and increasing spatial scale became a nationwide pattern.\n  \n        \n        Published\n    \n2016\nBenjamin Bellman, Seth E. Spielman, and Rachel S. Franklin. (2016) \"Local Population Change and Variations in Racial Integration in the United States, 2000‚Äì2010.\" International Regional Science ReviewAbstractWhile population growth has been consistently tied to decreasing racial segregation at the metropolitan level in the United States, little work has been done to relate small-scale changes in population size to integration. We address this question through a novel technique that tracks population changes by race and ethnicity for comparable geographies in both 2000 and 2010. Using the Theil index, we analyze the fifty most populous metropolitan statistical areas in 2010 for changes in multigroup segregation. We classify local areas by their net population change between 2000 and 2010 using a unique unit of analysis based on aggregating census blocks. We find strong evidence that growing parts of rapidly growing metropolitan areas of the United States are crucial to understanding regional differences in segregation that have emerged in past decades. Multigroup segregation declined the most in growing parts of growing metropolitan areas. Comparatively, growing parts of shrinking or stagnant metropolitan areas were less diverse and had smaller declines in segregation. We also find that local areas with shrinking populations had disproportionately high minority representation in 2000 before population loss took place. We conclude that the regional context of population growth or decline has important consequences for the residential mixing of racial groups.\n  \n        \n        PubMed\n    \n  \n        \n        Published\n    \nJohn R. Logan and Benjamin Bellman. (2016) \"Before The Philadelphia Negro: Residential Segregation in a Nineteenth-Century Northern City.\" Social Science HistoryAbstractAlthough some scholars treat racial residential segregation in northern cities as a twentieth-century phenomenon, recent research on New York and Chicago has shown that black-white segregation was already high and rising by 1880. We draw on data from the Philadelphia Social History Project and other new sources to study trends in this city as far back as 1850 and extending to 1900, a time when DuBois had completed his epic study of The Philadelphia Negro. Segregation of ‚Äúfree negroes‚Äù in Philadelphia was high even before the Civil War but did not increase as the total and black populations grew through 1900. Geocoded information from the full-count data from the 1880 Census makes it possible to map the spatial configuration of black residents in fine detail. At the scale of the street segment, segregation in that year was extraordinarily high, reflecting a micropattern in which many blacks lived in alleys and short streets. Although there was considerable class variation in the black community, higher-status black households lived in areas that were little different in racial and class composition than lower-status households.\n  \n        \n        PubMed\n    \n  \n        \n        Published"

I‚Äôm not as big a fan as him, but I love the LOTR books and movies, and we share a particular fondness for the Shire: him because of Anglophile agrarian idealism, and me for the rich bounty of geographic world-building that Tolkien shoveled into it.\nI know a lot of geographers swear by tmap, but my favorite viz tool will always be ggplot2, even for mapping. The wealth of companion packages that have been built for it is just so powerful. I also love the ability to hard-code label placements within the coordinate space of the data/chart, something I leaned on heavily for this project.\nMy objective was to create a classic Tolkien-style map as a standard 2560-by-1440 pixel desktop background. I wanted it to have that iconic Peter Jackson film style and leverage some 3D effects to highlight topography. I also wanted it to have enough detail to take you on a journey in your imagination but still be a usable background, letting your icons appear effortlessly and feel natural.

Evidence from newly available data for 134 cities in 1900‚Äì1940 puts this interpretation in question in several ways. We find that segregation was already high in 1900 at the neighborhood scale. Not only was it rising, but it was changing its spatial scale as clusters of Black settlement in side streets and alleys disappeared from White districts while expanding into large Black zones. Finally, multivariate analyses show that trends were similar in the North and South, and in neither region was Black population size (i.e., ‚ÄúBlack threat‚Äù) a significant predictor of increasing segregation. The general trends of rising segregation and increasing spatial scale became a nationwide pattern.\n  \n        \n        Published\n    \n2016\nBenjamin Bellman, Seth E. Spielman, and Rachel S.

We address this question through a novel technique that tracks population changes by race and ethnicity for comparable geographies in both 2000 and 2010. Using the Theil index, we analyze the fifty most populous metropolitan statistical areas in 2010 for changes in multigroup segregation. We classify local areas by their net population change between 2000 and 2010 using a unique unit of analysis based on aggregating census blocks. We find strong evidence that growing parts of rapidly growing metropolitan areas of the United States are crucial to understanding regional differences in segregation that have emerged in past decades. Multigroup segregation declined the most in growing parts of growing metropolitan areas. Comparatively, growing parts of shrinking or stagnant metropolitan areas were less diverse and had smaller declines in segregation. We also find that local areas with shrinking populations had disproportionately high minority representation in 2000 before population loss took place. We conclude that the regional context of population growth or decline has important consequences for the residential mixing of racial groups.\n  \n        \n        PubMed\n    \n  \n        \n        Published\n    \nJohn R.

We draw on data from the Philadelphia Social History Project and other new sources to study trends in this city as far back as 1850 and extending to 1900, a time when DuBois had completed his epic study of The Philadelphia Negro. Segregation of ‚Äúfree negroes‚Äù in Philadelphia was high even before the Civil War but did not increase as the total and black populations grew through 1900. Geocoded information from the full-count data from the 1880 Census makes it possible to map the spatial configuration of black residents in fine detail. At the scale of the street segment, segregation in that year was extraordinarily high, reflecting a micropattern in which many blacks lived in alleys and short streets. Although there was considerable class variation in the black community, higher-status black households lived in areas that were little different in racial and class composition than lower-status households.\n  \n        \n        PubMed\n    \n  \n        \n        Published"
